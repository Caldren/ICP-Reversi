ICP 2016 - Reversi/Othello

## Basic info
Main goal of this project was implementation of a 'game engine' for game
Reversi/Othello and creating independent TUI and GUI for this engine. The
conditions from project assignment were following:
    - C++ for the game core and TUI, C++/Qt for GUI
    - game core/engine has to:
        * keep history of each turn and allow to moving between
          turns (without breaking information about game state)
        * allow to load and save game in progress
        * support AI as one of the players with at least two simple
          algorithms and a simple API for adding another algorithms
    - player has to be able to:
        * select game board size (8 x 8 is an implicit value)
        * select player type
        * select AI's algorithm if needed
    - GUI/TUI has to show information about:
        * current state of game board
        * name/score of each player
        * current game state (in progress/end)
        * indication about possibility/impossiblity of given turn
    - GUI and TUI modules have to be independent on each another

## Compilation and running
Requirements:
    - GNU make
    - Qt 5.5 and newer
    - g++/clang++ with c++11 support
    - doxygen for documentation generation
    - correctly set up environment (correct path to qmake, etc.)

Simple execution of make command in the project root directory should create
additional necessary configuration files and compile the project into two
binaries - hra2016 (GUI version) and hra2016-cli (TUI version).

If you used Qt toolkit in non-standard location, you may need to set variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to lib/ subdir of your toolkit, eg:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH:=/usr/local/share/Qt-5.5.1/5.5/gcc_64/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

and create qt.conf configuration file with path to your Qt toolkit (example
qt.conf file can be found in conf/ directory).

By following these steps you should be able to run both versions of the game.

For documentation generation you need doxygen toolkit. The documentation
can be then generated by issuing make doxygen. Current destination is set
to doc/ folder.

## Notes
TUI version is compiled with -static-libstdc++ due to weird behavior of
g++-5.x on our school server. Also, CC in src/Makefile is set to g++-5.3
so it can be run on the aforementioned server.

Special thanks to Martin Briza, who helped me with Qt toolkit setup and
Jakub Mach for his proposal of a game board color.
